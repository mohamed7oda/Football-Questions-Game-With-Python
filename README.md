# Football-Questions-Game-With-Python
Interactive football trivia game using Python. This game involves players by presenting them with questions related to football. It offers four possible answers to each question as multiple choices. For each correct answer, players earn points, which contribute to their overall score. To enhance the game's difficulty, I incorporated checkpoints that assess players' knowledge at various levels. This element keeps the game engaging and challenging. In cases where players provide incorrect answers, the game deducts points. This feature encourages players to learn and enhance their football knowledge, making the gaming experience both enjoyable and educational. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to develop interactive Python-based applications, create engaging gameplay, and design features that promote both fun and learning.
